# AI Lab Assignments - State Space Search & Heuristic Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for various AI lab assignments focusing on state space search, heuristic techniques, and optimization algorithms. The assignments explore classical AI problems such as Missionaries and Cannibals, Rabbit Leap, Puzzle-8, and more, using search algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, and simulated annealing.

## Contents
1. **Missionaries and Cannibals Problem**
   - Problem: Safely transport missionaries and cannibals across a river using BFS and DFS.
   - Objective: Find the optimal solution with the fewest steps and compare search algorithms.
  
2. **Rabbit Leap Problem**
   - Problem: Help east-bound and west-bound rabbits cross each other without stepping into the water.
   - Objective: Model the problem as a state space search and solve using BFS and DFS. Compare results.

3. **Puzzle-8 Problem**
   - Problem: Solve the 8-puzzle problem using graph search techniques.
   - Objective: Implement BFS/DFS and Iterative Deepening Search, generate instances, and compare performance.

4. **Plagiarism Detection using A* Search**
   - Problem: Detect plagiarism by aligning text sequences from two documents.
   - Objective: Implement A* search to minimize edit distance and identify similar or plagiarized sentences.

5. **k-SAT Problem**
   - Problem: Randomly generate uniform random k-SAT problems.
   - Objective: Solve using Hill-Climbing, Beam-Search, and Variable-Neighborhood-Descent with heuristic functions.

6. **Simulated Annealing for TSP**
   - Problem: Plan a cost-effective tour of Rajasthan tourist locations.
   - Objective: Use simulated annealing to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

7. **Financial Time Series Analysis using HMM**
   - Problem: Model hidden market regimes using Gaussian Hidden Markov Models (HMM).
   - Objective: Analyze financial data to infer hidden states (e.g., bull and bear markets) and predict market transitions.

## Learning Objectives
